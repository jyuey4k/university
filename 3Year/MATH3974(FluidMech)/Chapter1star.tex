\section{Describing Fluid Flow: The convective derivative}

In our treatment of Fluid Dynamics we rely upon the continuum hypothesis, providing the assumption that the fluid's thermodynamic properties are well defined. In doing so we can describe a fluid by specifying its velocity $\vect{u}(\vect{x}, t)$ at any point in the domain of the fluid flow, along with pressure, $p (\vect{x}, t)$, its density $\rho (\vect{x}, t)$ and other variables of relevance.

Within such a discussion, there are two possible methods of describing our fluid flow scenarios; Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions. 

The Eulerian description aims at looking
